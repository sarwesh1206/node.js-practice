What's a Rendering Pattern?

In web development, a rendering pattern refers to the way in which the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is all processed and rendered in a web application or website.

1) Server-side rendering (SSR): In SSR, the web server generates the HTML content of a web page on the server-side and sends it to the client's browser. This approach can improve initial loading times and SEO (search engine optimization) but can be slower for dynamic content.

2) Client-side rendering (CSR): In CSR, the client's browser generates the HTML content of a web page on the client-side using JavaScript. This approach can provide a fast and interactive user experience but can be slower for initial loading times and bad for SEO.
