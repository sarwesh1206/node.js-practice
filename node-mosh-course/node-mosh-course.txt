Node.js provides asynchronous non-blocking code execution envionment.
Node.js wraps the v8 chrome engine inside c++ program.
# Node.js is a single threaded envionment. A single thread is responsible for handling all the request.
# Node.js is best suitable for I/O intensive and network intensive applications. It is not suitable for heavy CPU intensive program.

# variable declared with var keyword: its scope is limited to file only.
# if varible is not declared with var keyword: its scope is global.
#jshint command 

# upper carrot sign in package.json means update minor version of package.
# Tilde sign in package.json means update patch version of package.

# set PORT = 5000 // Assigning env variables

#Middleware is a function. It takes the request object and after processing request it send the response or passes the request to next Middleware.

# next keyword stores the reference of next Middleware function.

// get  the current envionment(NODE_ENV) by below commands
#process.env.NODE_ENV 

#app.get('env')  // Here app is the express object. It prints development by default.
# set method is used to set the variables in express env for e.g app.set('view engine','pug')

# use debug package to set the bebug level in the env.

# asynchronous means non-blocking programs.
# Promises holds the eventual result of asynchronous operation. 

#Sending custom headers in response
 res.header('x-auth-toke',token)
