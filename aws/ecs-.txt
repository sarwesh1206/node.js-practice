orchestrator: Manage the lifrcycle of containers create/destroy/restart and autoscaling

ECS has two launch types: EC2 & Fargate.
ECS does not have any compute power. It can only manage container.

#EC2 launch type: We have to manage the EC2 resouces. ECS maage the container using ECS control plane. We have full control over infra.

Fargate type: 
 AWS manage the underlying resouces. Fargate will create the servers on demand. 
 No need to provision/maintain EC2 servers.
 It follows a serverless architecture.

Cluster is a bunch of resources like ec2. cluster is the underlying resources on which the container is deployed

ECS tasks: How the container will be deployed. It is an instance of task definition.
