All dynamo db Tables has primary key. Dynamo has manadatory primary key. Primary key has maximum 2 attributes. Primary makes the Dynamo DB faster in reading the records. Manadatory key is called partitionon/hash and optional attribute is sort/range key.
primary key = partition key + sort key

In DynamoDB, tables, items, and attributes are the core components that you work with. A table is a collection of items, and each item is a collection of attributes. DynamoDB uses primary keys to uniquely identify each item in a table and secondary indexes to provide more querying flexibility.

Other than the primary key, the People table is schemaless, which means that neither the attributes nor their data types need to be defined beforehand. Each item can have its own distinct attributes.

Some of the items have a nested attribute (Address). DynamoDB supports nested attributes up to 32 levels deep.

When you create a table, in addition to the table name, you must specify the primary key of the table. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two items can have the same key.

The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term hash attribute derives from the use of an internal hash function in DynamoDB that evenly distributes data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

# Secondary indexes
DynamoDB supports two kinds of indexes:

1) Global secondary index – An index with a partition key and sort key that can be different from those on the table.

2)Local secondary index – An index that has the same partition key as the table, but a different sort key.

Read data projection in these indexes.

Each table in DynamoDB has a quota of 20 global secondary indexes (default quota) and 5 local secondary indexes.s

=============================================================

DynamoDB is a serverless cloud database.It is a serverless noSql database
#Compare Relational and noSql Db from video.

Data types in DynamoDB
1) Scalar- String,number
2)Set - Set of Strings and number
3) Document types- Complex structure with nested attribute. 

#Throughput Capacity
- Used to control read/wite Throughput
- Major factor in DynamoDB pricing
- 1 Capacity unit = 1 request/seec

Local secondary index is created at the time of Table creation. We cannot create it later
Global secondary index can be created at any time.

Scan Vs Query:
Filter is applied on non-key attributes

Query operation is fast as compared to Scan operation. Always try to use query operation. 
Scan operation scan the whole table while query operation search for the partion selected key/index.
